# Create reimbursements for employees. Employees will be logged and THEN their reimbursement requests
# will be accepted or denied.

# What would be the main entity for these employee reimbursement request scenarios?
# An employee object could have a method to store reimbursement requests.
# If the employee is already created as a table in postgres, then we could create just a reimbursement
# object.
