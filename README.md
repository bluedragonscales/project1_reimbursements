# project1_reimbursements
Second 3 tier web app

This is a project that features the ability to create and review reimbursements. Employees of a this fictional company can request reimbursements for things they bought for the sake of work. Managers of those employees can accept or reject the reimbursement requests depending on whether or not they believe the requests are legitimate.

The employees and managers were created directly in the database, so I've made the reimbursements into its own entity that the employees and managers can interact with.

These are the tables I created in the database for this project.
